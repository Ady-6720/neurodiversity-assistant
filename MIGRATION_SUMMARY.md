## 🔄 Key Changes

### Authentication Changes

**Before (Supabase):**
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email, password
});
```

**After (Firebase):**
```javascript
const userCredential = await createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
```

### Database Query Changes

**Before (Supabase - SQL-like):**
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('tasks')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

**After (Firebase - Firestore):**
```javascript
const q = query(
  collection(db, 'tasks'),
  where('user_id', '==', userId),
  orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
);
const querySnapshot = await getDocs(q);
const tasks = querySnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }));
```

### Data Structure Changes

**Supabase (PostgreSQL):**
- Tables with rows
- Auto-incrementing IDs or UUIDs
- SQL queries
- Row Level Security (RLS)

**Firebase (Firestore):**
- Collections with documents
- Auto-generated document IDs
- NoSQL queries
- Security Rules

## 🗄️ Database Schema Mapping

| Supabase Table | Firebase Collection | Status |
|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| `user_profiles` | `user_profiles` | ✅ Migrated |
| `tasks` | `tasks` | ✅ Migrated |
| `schedules` | `schedules` | ✅ Migrated |
| `sensory_preferences` | `sensory_preferences` | ✅ Migrated |
| `sensory_events` | `sensory_events` | ✅ Migrated |
| `focus_sessions` | `focus_sessions` | ✅ Migrated |
| `cognitive_exercises` | `cognitive_exercises` | ✅ Migrated |
| `communication_templates` | `communication_templates` | ⚠️ Not yet used |
| `cognitive_entries` | `cognitive_entries` | ⚠️ Not yet used |

---

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Supabase (Before)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- PostgreSQL-based access control
- SQL-based policy definitions

### Firebase (After)
- Firestore Security Rules
- JavaScript-like rule syntax
- Document-level access control

**Example Security Rule:**
```javascript
match /tasks/{taskId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.user_id == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## 📦 Dependencies

### Removed
```json
"@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.53.0"
```

### Added
```json
"firebase": "^10.7.1"
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Firebase Project
Follow instructions in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`:
- Create Firebase project
- Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
- Create Firestore database
- Configure security rules
- Get Firebase config credentials

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Firebase credentials
```

### 4. Test the Application
```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Verify Functionality
- ✅ User registration
- ✅ User login/logout
- ✅ Task creation and management
- ✅ Schedule management
- ✅ Cognitive exercises
- ✅ Sensory tracking
- ✅ Focus sessions

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Considerations

### 1. **Composite Queries**
Firestore requires indexes for complex queries with multiple `where` clauses. Firebase will automatically suggest creating indexes when needed.

### 2. **Query Limitations**
- Can't use multiple inequality filters on different fields
- Range queries require careful index planning
- Some queries may need client-side filtering

### 3. **No Server-Side Joins**
Unlike SQL, Firestore doesn't support joins. Related data must be:
- Denormalized (duplicated)
- Fetched separately
- Structured differently

### 4. **Pricing Differences**
- **Supabase**: Based on database size and bandwidth
- **Firebase**: Based on reads, writes, and storage
- Monitor usage in Firebase Console

### 5. **Real-time Subscriptions**
Current implementation uses one-time queries. Firebase supports real-time listeners:
```javascript
// Can be added later for real-time updates
onSnapshot(collection(db, 'tasks'), (snapshot) => {
  // Handle real-time updates
});
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Missing Firebase environment variables"**
- Ensure `.env.local` exists with all Firebase config values
- Restart the development server after adding variables

**2. "Permission denied" errors**
- Check Firestore security rules are published
- Verify user is authenticated
- Ensure `user_id` field matches authenticated user's UID

**3. "Index required" errors**
- Firebase will provide a link to create the required index
- Click the link and create the index in Firebase Console
- Wait a few minutes for index to build

**4. Authentication not persisting**
- Firebase Auth uses AsyncStorage for persistence (already configured)
- Clear app data if issues persist

**5. Queries returning empty results**
- Check field names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify data exists in Firestore Console
- Check security rules allow read access

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Operations**: Use `batch()` for multiple writes
2. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large datasets using `startAfter()`
3. **Indexes**: Create composite indexes for frequently used queries
4. **Caching**: Firebase SDK caches data automatically
5. **Offline Support**: Enable offline persistence if needed

### Monitoring
- Use Firebase Console → Performance Monitoring
- Track read/write operations
- Monitor authentication events
- Set up budget alerts
